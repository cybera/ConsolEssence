In a sense, one could compare LXC to QEMU, while comparing LXD to libvirt.\n\nThe LXC API deals with a ‘container’. The LXD API deals with ‘remotes’, which serve images and containers. This extends the LXC functionality over the network, and allows concise management of tasks like container migration and container image publishing.\n\nLXD uses LXC under the covers for some container management tasks. However, it keeps its own container configuration information and has its own conventions, so that it is best not to use classic LXC commands by hand with LXD containers.
